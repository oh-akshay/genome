      "description": "Many toddlers initially hesitate with messy substances, but by 1½-2½ years, most delight in squishing, splashing, and smearing during play. They might dig hands into sand, smear finger paint, or jump in puddles eagerly. Enjoyment of messy play suggests their tactile sensory system can handle various stimuli and they associate these sensations with fun, not discomfort.",

      "description": "By age 2-3, the child has better strategies and tolerance for sudden sensory input. For example, if a loud sound occurs (vacuum, blender, thunder), they might flinch or cover their ears but not meltdown like before, especially if warned. Similarly, bright sunlight might make them squint or ask for sunglasses but not cry. This shows improved sensory modulation — they can handle moderate sensory stressors or use simple coping actions (covering ears, closing eyes) to self-protect.",
